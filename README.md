# Rotational Controls Experiment
 
In this experiment, I studied a forced rotational mechanical system consisting of inertial, spring, and damper elements, forming a 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF) dynamic system. These experiments highlight the  analysis of the unknown system parameters through open-loop 1-DoF step and impulse response testing, the validation of the parameters, and the implementation of the estimates in designing and verifying a control algorithm. In the experiments, 2 heavy disks were connected by a rotational spring, aligned vertically, and had there displacement measured by encoders. Each disk was also connected to dampers. In the first experiment, the top disk was held in place to measure the step response of the bottom disk when a constant motor torque is applied to it. In the second experiment, the bottom disk was held in place to measure the impulse response of the top disk when a hand twists it briefly. In the following code, damping and spring coefficients as well as moments of inertia of the two disks are derived and verified.
